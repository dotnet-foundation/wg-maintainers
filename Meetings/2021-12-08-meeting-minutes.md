## Notes

### Process for Leaving the Foundation

- Reviewed the process to leave the Foundation as posted in the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/68#discussioncomment-1774246).
- After all comments have been reviewed, the board will meet with the lawyers to reverse the contracts of the projects that have sent notices to leave. The board will work with each of the aforementioned projects individually.
- Question was raised, "What if the original maintainers are no longer available?"
- Existing projects should have a paper trail of who their maintainers are.
- We need to expand on our messaging around why the original signatories must be involved.
- Do we need a process whereby a project maintainer can pass on the rights to make these decisions to new maintainers in the future?
- Process should be explained on how to leave the DNF, as you are going through the onboarding process.

### New Business

- Help for projects to setup CLA bots, CoC, signing, etc. The project committee is reviewing this for seed projects.
- Need to define a process for communicating changes to projects.
- James Newton-King would like to update the webpage for why you should join the foundation. Rob P welcomes this idea and will review a submitted PR.

## Action Items

- [ ] Rob and Mattias to take the comments on the process back to the board.
