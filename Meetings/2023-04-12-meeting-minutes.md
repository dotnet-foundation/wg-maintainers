## Agenda

- Review Action Items
- Request from the community to get more maintainers added to projects. Discussion on maybe matching members to projects for support. How: create an issue here?
- Project Benefits:
  - What are they currently, who is utilizing them, how are they being 'paid for', if/when do they expire?
  - Why: Documentation, we want to update our tracker to make sure we catch any expiring benefits before it happens. Including Domains, Password safes, Azure/AWS credits, code signing (Microsoft/in-kind sponsorship item), add a long-term check-in plan.
  - GitHub Copilot
- Define the process/document the ways to ask for support and workflow/Responsible parties; Support@dotnetfoundation.org or an Issue logged in Maintainer's committee - How else can we handle these items so they don't get missed or forgotten.
- Discussion around marketing pieces for each project - written by members for the .NET Foundation blog

## Notes

- How do we reach out to maintainers?
- We want better overlap between maintainers in projects?
- Do we have a contact point/webpage on how to get involved?
- Guide on what is open source, how to get involved, etc. on the main website
- We will need someone to volunteer to write the how to get involved page.
- Are their already resources on GitHub
- [Being a good open source citizen](https://www.devlead.se/posts/2017/2017-01-25-being-a-good-open-source-citizen)
- Updating the website requires contact@dotnetfoundation.org email
- Project benefits
  - Silk.NET has an Azure resource group. Want to make that a formal process.
  - Higher perfomance runners for Github Actions. Can we provision
  - AWS credits are available to be applied
  - GitHub Copilot subscriptions for members could be useful but not a wide ask
  - The new GitHub PR review Copilot would be useful
  - Beyond code signing there are infrastructure
  - Code indexing, sybols hosting, centralized documentation
  - James had a pull request on the old site for a benefits page. What happened to it?
  - Cake index nuget org for Cake addins adn provide documentation for community projects too, https://cakebuild.net/extensions/
  - Badges for projects like number of contributors
  - How do we get the word out about our projects?
- Projects asking for support,
  - Discord works well
  - Emails go into black holes
  - We need to document how to make the requests
- If Members/Maintatiners want to write for the blog, they should reach out via email or Discord
- The blog hasn't been moved to the new site yet, but will go live once we have enough content
- Where are we with code signing?
  - If teams are interested, they should reach out to Chris
  - Tool is still in preview, but teams can reach out as they are ready
  - Do projects know about the code signing deadline?
- There needs to be a better connection between DNF and MS stakeholders. Emails, escalations, and even F2F are not always effective.
- Issues raised like https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/issues/214 are not being addressed in a timely manner.

## Action Items

- [ ] Find volunteer to write a how to get involved in open source projects
