- Nicole Miller
- Stacey Ramsey

## Agenda

- Switch to 1Password
- Update to the CLA Bot
- Update to the Signing Service
- Other business

## Notes

- We are switching from LastPass to 1Password because of security issues
- We are rolling out the new CLA bot which requires fewer permissions
- Chris raised a discussion in each organization
- ReactiveUI team asking for more information or links
- Chris is trying to document the process as he goes so that we will have the full process documented
- Mattias has access to the new signing service but hasn't started testing yet
- More will be handled in the tool itself and less in Azure so the tool should be more stable
- There are no hard deadlines to migrated, but the existing CLA bot and signing service are falling apart and a required Azure service is being shut down
- There has been negative feedback on the new website, projects have gone missing and there is no clear path to providing updates
- For updates to the website, communication channels will be provided, for now, email contact@dotnetfoundation.org
- https://github.com/cake-build/cake/discussions/4124 are the current discussion/instructions for the CLA bot
