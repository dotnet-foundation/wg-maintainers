# Project Maintainers' Working Group

## Committee Merger

The Maintainers' Committee was founded to hear the concerns and suggestions of the Foundation's member projects. We feel that the mandate of the committee has been fullfilled and that our current discussions overlap with the mandate of the [Project Committee](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects). As a result, the board has voted to merge the Maintainers' Committee back into the Project Committee.

We encourage all members of the committee to attend the [Project Committee](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects) meetings and continue the discussion there. Thank you for all your help and ideas.
